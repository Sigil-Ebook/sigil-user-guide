## <center>Guidelines for contributing</center>

<br/>

1. __NO ARTISTIC/AESTHETIC CHANGES PLEASE!__ We're only interested in content updates and corrections, or updated screenshots that show new menus or new features. If you're hoping to "jazz things up" or redo the the style of the epub to reflect your personal style or formatting preferences, you're probably going to be disappointed. Pull Requests that include stylistic changes or "upgrades" will be declined (unless such work has been pre-approved of course).

2. __Less is best__. Several smaller, tightly focused Pull Requests are always going to be preferred over ones that represent grand, sweeping changes to large swathes of the manual. We don't want to have to read the entire manual each and every time we're evaluating a new Pull Request. Neither would you.  Be considerate if you want to see your efforts incorporated.

3. __Don't Break anything__. Changes that break the resulting epub or cause validation issues will be rejected. It's your responsibility to make sure the epub structure remains intact and spec compliant.

## <center>Preferred Workflow</center>

<br/>

- Fork this repository to your own Github account and clone a local copy of it to your computer.

- Use the [FolderIn Sigil plugin](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=293649) to load the contents of the "src" directory of your local, cloned repository into Sigil.

- Do your editing (saving changes to a local temporary epub somewhere if you must). Remember to use "Mend and Prettify" after you're done, and always make sure the epub validates with no errors. Then when ready, save the contents back to the "src" directory of your local, cloned repository using the [FolderOut Sigil plugin](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=293649).

- Use the normal git tools to check your differences and then when satisfied, commit and push your changes to your Github fork.

- Create a new Pull Request from your Github account so that we can review and hopefully pull your changes into the project.
