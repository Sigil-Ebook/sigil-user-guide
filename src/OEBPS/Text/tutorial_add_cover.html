  <h2>Add a Cover Image</h2>

  <p>Every book should have a cover image, and Sigil can make adding one to your EPUB easy. You will need to have an existing cover image available to use (and have permission to use it). The exact size of the cover is up to you and the guidelines for your device.</p>

  <p>To add a cover, just select the menu item <span class="menuitem">Add Cover</span>:</p>

  <div class="image">
    <img alt="tutorial-add-cover" src="../Images/tutorial-add-cover.png"/>
  </div>

  <p>The Add Cover window shows you a list of images already in your EPUB. But since you haven’t loaded any images yet, it’s empty.</p>

  <p>You can insert the image into your EPUB and make it the cover in one step by clicking on the <span class="buttonbox">Other Files</span> button.</p>

  <p>Select your cover image from your filesystem and click OK.</p>

  <p>And that’s it. Sigil has added your image to the EPUB and marked it as the cover image. It has also created an HTML file at the start of your book and inserted your cover image into the file so that it will be displayed at the start of the book:</p>

  <div class="image">
    <img alt="tutorial-add-cover-browser" src="../Images/tutorial-add-cover-browser.png"/>
  </div>

  <p>You should Save <img alt="button-save" src="../Images/button-save.png"/> your book.</p>
