  <p class="h2subheading">— Using Open With to Edit Files —</p>

  <p>Sigil is a powerful editor, but it can’t edit images, and it may not have some of the features you use in other editors. When this happens, you can use Sigil’s Open With feature to open and edit files in your preferred external program — and when you save, Sigil will immediately and automatically update its copy. This is very useful if you want to quickly edit images or CSS stylesheets and immediately see how changes affect the layout of your book (in Preview), all while keeping an HTML file open in Code View.</p>

  <p>To edit a file in an external program, right-click on the file’s name in the Book Browser and choose <span class="menuitem">Open With</span> from the context menu:</p>

  <div class="image">
    <img alt="external-open-with" src="../Images/external-open-with.png"/>
  </div>

  <p>The first time you open a file type this way, you will need to choose an application to use with that file type. You can define and save up to five different external applications for each file type (.html, .css, .jpg, .png, .opf, etc.).</p>

  <p>You can then give the application a friendly name that will be used in the menu the next time you use <span class="menuitem">Open With</span>:</p>

  <div class="image">
    <img alt="external-open-name" src="../Images/external-open-name.png"/>
  </div>

  <p>When you next use <span class="menuitem">Open With</span> you will see the friendly names you’ve given your existing applications, and the option to choose another application (up to five per file type).</p>

  <div class="image">
    <img alt="external-open-with-name" src="../Images/external-open-with-name.png"/>
  </div>

  <div class="tip">
    <p class="tiptext">If you make changes to a file in Sigil while the file is being edited in an external program, you may lose data. When using an external editor, always make the changes, then save and close the file in the external application before making any changes to that file in Sigil.</p>
