  <p class="h2subheading">— A Map Of Your Book —</p>

  <p>EPUB supports a Table of Contents (abbreviated as TOC) to help readers navigate their way around your book. Typically EPUB e-readers provide a button or menu item to open the TOC.</p>

  <p>Sigil provides several ways to work with a TOC. The Table of Contents window in Sigil gives you a dynamic view of your TOC – you can view exactly what your TOC looks like, and select entries to jump to. The Generate TOC function can create a new TOC based on the headings in your document. The Edit TOC function allows you to update an existing TOC when you can’t or don’t want to use Generate TOC. And Create HTML TOC can create a new HTML page in your document showing what is in the EPUB TOC.</p>

  <p>The EPUB TOC is stored in a special XML file called the NCX (typically named toc.ncx) under EPUB2 and in an XHTML document called the NAV (typically named nav.xhtml) under EPUB3. These files are designed to be machine readable so that both e-readers and accessibility software can use them to allow the user to quickly and efficiently navigate throughout the EPUB.</p>

  <h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">View the TOC</h3>

  <p>To open the TOC window if it isn’t already open select the menu item <span class="menuitem">View=&gt;Table of Contents</span>:</p>

  <div class="image">
    <img alt="Image of Sigil's Table of Contents window." src="../Images/toc-main.png"/>
  </div>

  <p>You can single-click on an entry to jump to its location in the book, and expand or collapse entries by clicking on the icons to the left of the chapter names if there are sub-chapters.</p>

  <div class="tip">
    <p class="tiptext">Use the right-click context menu to select <span class="menuitem">Collapse All</span> or <span class="menuitem">Expand All</span> to quickly show or hide sub-chapters.</p>
  </div>

  <h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Generate Table of Contents</h3>

  <p>In order to create a Table of Contents automatically you first need to define the headings or chapters in your book.</p>

  <p>In Code View you can create the your headings by selecting the text you want to make into a heading, and then selecting the level of the heading you want from the <span class="menuitem">Format=&gt;Heading</span> menu. Or more easily by using the formatting buttons on the toolbar.</p>

  <div class="image">
    <img alt="Heading toolbar menu." src="../Images/headings.png" style="width:40%"/>
  </div>

  <div class="tip">
    <p class="tiptext">If your chapter names do not use heading tags (<span class="example">h1</span>, <span class="example">h2</span>, etc.) as described above, then you will not be able to generate a TOC automatically. As heading tags are very important for Accessibility reasons you should strongly consider adding them.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Start your TOC generation by clicking the Generate Table of Contents button <img alt="Image of Generate Tabl;e of Contents icon." src="../Images/generate-toc.png"/>, or selecting the menu item <span class="menuitem">Tools=&gt;Table Of Contents=&gt;Generate Table Of Contents</span> then select the headings you want included in the book’s Table of Contents:</p>

  <div class="image">
    <img alt="Generate Table of Contents dialog." src="../Images/toc-generate-toc.png"/>
  </div>

  <p>Check any name that you want to be included in the Table of Contents, and uncheck any entry that you don’t want included.</p>

  <div class="tip">
    <p class="tiptext">When you use Generate Table Of Contents Sigil will update not only your TOC, but also your HTML documents – to make sure that the information you enter can be used again when you next generate the TOC.</p>
  </div>

  <p>You can use the <span class="buttonbox">Show TOC Items Only</span> checkbox to show or hide entries that will not be included in the TOC. This does not affect your TOC, only what you see in the dialog. You can also use the <span class="buttonbox">Select headings to include in TOC</span> drop-down menu to quickly select or unselect headings of a certain type, and then fine tune the selections manually.</p>

  <p>You can rename the TOC entry by clicking <span class="buttonbox">Rename</span>. This will also change your HTML code to set the “title” attribute of your heading.</p>

  <p>You can change the level of your Headings using the left and right arrow keys. This will also change the level of the headings in your HTML code.</p>

  <div class="tip">
    <p class="tiptext">The tooltip for each title (just move your mouse over the title and leave it for a few seconds) will show you which file the heading is in and its HTML code.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The tooltip for the headings of table will show you the number of headings of each type:</p>

  <div class="image">
    <img alt="Using tool tips to show additional information in Table of Contents generator." src="../Images/toc-tooltip.png"/>
  </div>

  <p>When you select <span class="buttonbox">OK</span>, Sigil will add or update automatically generated IDs to any headings you have selected if they don’t have regular IDs already. It will then create a new NCX file on EPUB2 and Update the NAV file on EPUB3 that contain links to your chapters. If your heading is “near” the beginning of your HTML file, Sigil will link directly to the file and not to the heading ID. This is because on some e-readers linking directly to an element slows down the display of the TOC.</p>

  <div class="tip">
    <p class="tiptext">Generating the TOC automatically will overwrite any existing TOC in the <span class="example">toc.ncx file of an EPUB2</span> or the <span class="example">nav.xhtml file of an EPUB3</span>.</p>
  </div>

  <h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc" id="edit_toc">Edit Table of Contents</h3>

  <p>If you can’t or don’t want to generate the TOC from the headings in the document, you can use Edit Table Of Contents to make changes to the existing TOC. Any changes made to the TOC will not affect your HTML files, and all changes would be lost if you use Generate TOC.</p>

  <div class="image">
    <img alt="Image of Table of Contents Editor in action." src="../Images/edit-toc.png"/>
  </div>

  <p>You can edit an entry by double-clicking on it. You can add new entries or delete existing ones. Use the arrows to increase or decrease the heading level of an entry.</p>

  <p>To change what a TOC entry points to you can type in the target destination directly, or use the <span class="buttonbox">Insert Link</span> button. This will open the Select Target dialog where you can choose which location to point the TOC entry to:</p>

  <div class="image">
    <img alt="Insert Link select target dialog." src="../Images/select-target.png"/>
  </div>

  <p>The right-click context menu allows you to delete or rename entries, or expand or collapse the list.</p>

  <div class="tip">
    <p class="tiptext">TOC entries must point to a valid target. If you just want a heading in the TOC, point it to the next valid entry.</p>
  </div>

  <h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc" id="generate_html_toc">Generate HTML Table of Contents</h3>

  <p>You can use the menu <span class="menuitem">Tools=&gt;Table Of Contents=&gt;Generate HTML Table of Contents</span> to create an Inline HTML TOC for your EPUB. This type of table of contents is meant to be seen and used by human readers and need not be machine readable unlike the NCX or NAV.</p>

  <div class="image">
    <img alt="Image of Generated HTML Table of Contents in Preview" src="../Images/toc-html.png"/>
  </div>

  <p>An inline TOC is just another HTML page in the EPUB that contains the Table of Contents in text format with links that can be used to jump to specific chapters.</p>

  <p>Another reason for creating an HTML Table of Contents is that these can be converted to other ebook formats that do not support the NCX of EPUB2 or NAV of EPUB3.</p>

  <p>The Generate HTML Table of Contents menu item will overwrite any existing HTML TOC file (if it has a semantic type of TOC). If no such file exists it will create an HTML file called <span class="example">toc.html</span> and mark its semantic type as TOC. If <span class="example">toc.html</span> already exists it will be replaced.</p>

  <div class="tip">
    <p class="tiptext">You can change the contents of the inline TOC once you’ve created it – but remember to do this each time you create the TOC.</p>
  </div>

  <h4 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Custom HTML TOC Stylesheet</h4>

  <p>The generated HTML TOC page uses a separate CSS file (<span class="example">sgc-toc.css</span>) to format the TOC. If the file already exists in your book it will not be overwritten (so you can customise it without losing your changes). But if it does not exist, it will look for <span class="example">sgc-toc.css</span> in your preferences directory and use that as the default file. If there is no file in your preferences directory, then Sigil will create a default stylesheet for the TOC.</p>

  <p>If you’re generating an EPUB3 TOC, Sigil will look for <span class="example">sgc-nav.css</span> in your preferences directory and use that as the default file.</p>

  <h4 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Update The NCX TOC In EPUB3 Books</h4>

  <p>If you create an EPUB3 book with Sigil or open an EPUB3 book without an NCX file, no NCX will exist. If you would like to add an NCX to make your EPUB3 more backwards compatible after editing is finished, use <span class="menuitem">Tools=&gt;Epub3 Tools=&gt;Generate NCX/Guide for epub2 e-readers</span> menu item to generate and add a NCX that older EPUB2-only devices should be able to use.</p>
