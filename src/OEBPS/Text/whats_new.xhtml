  <h2 id="whats_new">What’s New</h2>

  <p>The latest versions of Sigil contain hundreds of changes, bug fixes and new features while still retaining the majority of the same easy to use interface of earlier versions. Almost all of Sigil’s code has been updated and improved with particular focus on the following areas:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p><span class="listheading">Stability:</span> All known crashes and related bugs from previous versions have been identified and fixed – making Sigil completely stable for updating your EPUBs.</p></li>

    <li><p><span class="listheading">Robustness:</span> Sigil can correct even more common problems when reading files, and will no longer exit when opening invalid EPUBs. Saving has been enhanced to perform more integrity checks. Splits and merges can now be done exactly where you want without potential data loss. The cursor position is correctly updated between Code View and Preview, and Find &amp; Replace works consistently and accurately over one or all files.</p></li>

    <li><p><span class="listheading">Performance:</span> Sigil is now significantly faster in many areas: opening and changing tabs, generating a TOC, merging files, bulk renaming, replacing text, etc.</p></li>

    <li><p><span class="listheading">Flexibility:</span> More preferences, options and features were added to let you use Sigil the way you want.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>Recent Major Changes in Sigil include:</b></p>

  <ul>
    <li><p><span class="listheading">Switch from QtWebKit to QtWebEngine</span> QtWebEngine reduces memory growth and plugs many major memory leaks and has ongoing security and support patches from Qt/Google/Chromium</p></li>

    <li><p><span class="listheading">Update to Qt6.7.X from Qt 5.15.X</span></p></li>


    <li><p><span class="listheading">Removal of Book View</span> because it allowed users to mistakenly create very broken xhtml that was not acceptable in an EPUB. To replace part of its functionality, we created a new external program called <a href="https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/PageEdit/releases">PageEdit</a> that is better suited for basic WYSIWYG proofing and simple Edits. Users who know no xhtml or css will probably want to stay with Sigil 0.9.14 as it was the last version to support BookView. More on PageEdit and integrating it into Sigil <a href="external_xhtml_editor.xhtml">can be found in this chapter</a>.</p></li>

    <li><p><span class="listheading">Support for Python Plugins</span> to allow users to customize and integrate how they use Sigil into their own workflow and to add the tools they need or want independently from Sigil. These plugins can be downloaded and installed to add extended support to Sigil. These plugins include epubcheck, Access-Aide, KindleImport, Kindlegen, FlightCrew, ePub3-itizer, DOCX Import plugins, and etc. More about plugins, and where to download and how to install them will be described in a later chapter.</p></li>

    <li><p><span class="listheading">Support for Preserving User Specified entities</span></p></li>

    <li><p><span class="listheading">Sigil embeds its own Python interpreter</span> (v3.11.9 at the time of this writing to support Python 3 based plugins.</p></li>

    <li><p><span class="listheading">Sigil uses a specially modified version of Google’s Gumbo Parser</span> to auto correct xhtml parsing errors according to the html5 and xhtml specs.</p></li>

    <li><p><span class="listheading">Sigil now fully supports editing and creating reflowable EPUB2 and EPUB3 EPUBs.</span></p></li>

    <li><p><span class="listheading">Sigil has removed its longtime restrictions on EPUB layouts.</span>  Custom EPUB layouts are fully supported.</p></li>

  </ul>
