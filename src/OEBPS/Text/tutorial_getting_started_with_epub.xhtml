  <h2 id="tutorial_what_is_epub">Getting Started With EPUB</h2>

  <p>If you are going to create an EPUB ebook, it’s probably a good idea to understand what EPUB is and how Sigil can help.</p>

  <p>EPUB is a standard file format created to display books, and Sigil helps you create EPUBs. Sigil is designed to take the book you created in a word processor and convert it to a standard EPUB file that can be published and read on e-readers. It can also be used to clean up and reformat existing EPUBs.</p>

  <p>How much you want or need to “clean up” your EPUB depends on you. If you are just formatting a book for yourself you may not be concerned with too many details and will be able to use Sigil just enough to get it to look right on your e-reader. But if you are formatting for publication then you’ll find Sigil makes it easy to access and change any detail about your book.</p>

  <p>When you edit a document in a typical word processor you usually end up with 1 file, e.g. mybook.doc. This file contains all the information about your document. An EPUB is slightly different. Instead of using just 1 file to store your information, it uses separate files to store the parts that make up your document: chapters, images, table of contents, etc. But because it would be difficult to share lots of separate files with people, all these separate files are actually stored into a single compressed zip file with the file extension .epub, e.g. mybook.epub. An EPUB file is actually just a zip file that contains all of the files needed by your book.</p>

  <p>Sigil can open and create EPUB files, and it allows you to edit, rearrange, and format the individual files in the EPUB (like your text and table of contents).</p>

  <p>Once you copy or import your document into Sigil, it becomes part of the EPUB file. And when you save your book in Sigil, your document is saved in the EPUB file.</p>

  <p>Note that Sigil is designed to work equally well with the old EPUB 2 standard or the newer EPUB 3 standard. Many older e-readers only support EPUB 2,  although by adding a Guide and NCX to the newer EPUB 3 version and restricting it to EPUB 2 features, a fully backwards compatible EPUB 3 can be generated that should work well on all e-readers.</p>

<p>EPUB 3 EPUBs are quickly becoming the international publishing standard as they support both Right-To-Left (RTL) and Left-To-Right (LTR) text layout, audio, video, internal and external resources, and better support Accessibility features by allowing multi-media overlays, improved semantic role labelling, and even limited javascript for interactive features.</p>
